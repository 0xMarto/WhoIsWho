Who is Who is an online 2 player game. 
To win, the player must guess the opponents card by asking questions about the cards on the board before the opponent guesses his.

Cheating:
Cheating is allowed in Who Is Who. However, there is a catch. Each time a player lies about the answer, a cheating counter is increased.
At the end of the game, the player who lied the most automatically loses.
